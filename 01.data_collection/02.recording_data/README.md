# GTU-RIR : COLLECTING REAL RIR DATA / RECORDING DATA

1. Before starting to record any data, we need to prepare our setup which is described in [setting to work][setting_to_work].

2. The scripts for recording sound and how to run them are explained in [02.recording_data][02.recording_data].

3. The scripts for cleaning and for extracting RIR are explained in [03.post_processing][03.post_processing].

4. The scripts for data position heatmaps and sound wave plots are explained in [04.data_statistics][04.data_statistics].
 
5. The scripts for " generating synthetic data using [FAST-RIR][FAST-RIR] and comparing to real data "   
   are explained in [05.fast-rir][05.fast-rir].
