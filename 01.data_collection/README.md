# GTU-RIR : COLLECTING REAL RIR DATA

1. The construction of devices needed to collect sound data is described in [01.constructing_device][01.constructing_device].

2. The scripts for recording sound and how to run them are explained in [02.recording_data][02.recording_data].

3. The scripts for cleaning and for extracting RIR are explained in [03.post_processing][03.post_processing].

4. The scripts for data position heatmaps and sound wave plots are explained in [04.data_statistics][04.data_statistics].
   1. RIR.pickle.dat file ( 5GB pickle data file containing all RIR sound waves and metadata ) is generated in this phase also.
 
5. The scripts for " generating synthetic data using [FAST-RIR][FAST-RIR] and comparing to real data "   
   are explained in [05.fast-rir][05.fast-rir].
